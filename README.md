# Game of Drones

In Game of Drones there are two players trying to conquer each other. Players
take turns to make their move, choosing Paper, Rock or Scissors. Each move
beats another, just like the game “Paper, rock, scissors”. Like so:

  - Paper beats Rock
  - Rock beats scissors
  - Scissors beat Paper

The first player to beat the other player 3 times wins the battle.
